tagline: hpcviewer is the presentation layer of HPCToolkit which is a suite of tools for measurement and analysis of program performance.

hpcviewer is a graphical user interface that interactively presents performance data in three complementary code-centric views (top-down, bottom-up, and flat), as well as a graphical view that enables one to assess performance variability across threads and processes. hpcviewer is designed to facilitate rapid top-down analysis using derived metrics that highlight scalability losses and inefficiency rather than focusing exclusively on program hot spots.

hpcviewer also presents a hierarhical, time-centric view of a program execution. The tool can rapidly render graphical views of trace lines for thousands of processors for an execution tens of minutes long even a laptop. hpcviewer's hierarchical graphical presentation is quite different than that of other tools - it renders execution traces at multiple levels of abstraction by showing activity over time at different call stack depths.
