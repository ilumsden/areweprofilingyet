tagline: Caliper is an HPC profiling tool that acts as the "glue" that connects various independent context annotations, measurement services, and data processing services.

Caliper is a library to integrate performance profiling capabilities into applications. To use Caliper, developers mark code regions of interest using Caliper's annotation API. Applications can then enable performance profiling at runtime with Caliper's configuration API. Alternatively, you can configure Caliper through environment variables or config files.

Caliper can be used for lightweight always-on profiling or advanced performance engineering use cases, such as tracing, monitoring, and auto-tuning. It is primarily aimed at HPC applications, but works for any C/C++/Fortran program on Unix/Linux.
