# AreWeProfilingYet?

This website is a curation of profiling, tracing, and performance data analysis tools. It was inspired by [the various AreWeXYet? websites](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet) in the Rust community.

## Status

This website is currently in its earliest stages. For now, this site will be updated whenever I get the chance.

Currently, this site is hosted at https://ilumsden.github.io/areweprofilingyet. I hope to eventualy move it to the custom domain areweprofilingyet.com.
